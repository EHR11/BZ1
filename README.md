 # BZ1_V0.1  <h>BlitZenz Sensor V0.1</h>  Arduino Sketch for a simple Atmospheric Sensor using an ESP32 NodeMCU module, a DHT11 Temp/Humidiy Sensor and an MQ135 Amospheric Gasses Sensor..  It connects to an MQTT server then:   - publishes "OK" to the topic "Start"   - subscribes to the topic "in", printing out any sting messages     it receives.   - Reads both sensors' outputs and publishes them through the "out" topic
